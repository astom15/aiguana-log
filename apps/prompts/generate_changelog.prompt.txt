Based on the following Pull Request information, generate a concise and user-friendly changelog title (plain text), and a clear, natural-sounding changelog description written in Markdown.

The tone should be professional but conversational â€” avoid overly stiff or robotic phrasing. The description may use bullet points, and each sentence should end in a period. Use natural language that clearly communicates the purpose and impact of the changes.

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object containing the keys "generated_title" and "markdown_description". Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting before or after the JSON object.
